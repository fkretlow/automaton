# fsm-clj

A tiny library to model finite state machines. No macros, just Clojure data structures.

## Usage

```clojure
(use '[com.fkretlow.fsm-clj :refer [make-fsm process-event]])

(let [states [[:0,                    ; 1st state: :0
               \a :a],                ;   - transitions to :a on event \a
              [:a,                    ; 2nd state: :a
               \a :a,                 ;   - circles back to :a on event \a
               \b :0 inc,             ;   - transitions to :0 on event \b and applies inc to the value
               :0]],                  ;   - transitions to :0 on all other events
      count-ab (make-fsm states 0)]   ; make the state machine with an initial value of 0
  ; process single events
  (prn (-> count-ab                     
           (process-event \a)
           (process-event \b)
           :value))
  ; or use reduce to process all at once
  (prn (:value (reduce process-event count-ab "ababab")))
;;=> 1
;;=> 3
```

The vector of states given to `make-fsm` must satisfy the following grammar
```
states-vector:        [state+]
state:                [state-key transition-list | state-function]
transition-list       transition-on-event* default-transition?
state-key:            keyword
transition-on-event:  event transition
default-transition:   transition
state-function:       a function taking an event and returning a vector
                      containing the elements of a transition as defined below
event:                anything
transition:           state-key actions?
actions:              function | non-empty seqable of functions
```
where `*` means \"zero or more\", `?` means \"at most one\", `+` means \"at least one\", and `|` means \"or\"."

If more than one function is given for `actions`, the functions will be composed in the given order and applied to the current value.

The order of the states is important, as the FSM will be initialized in the first state.
